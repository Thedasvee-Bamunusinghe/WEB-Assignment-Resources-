		17 goals was pointed out in the 2030 Agenda as to benefit the scope parties mentioned. 
	<br>
	The Sustainabale Development Goals was signed by 193 countries globally, where they do track the progress of each country within their 3 dimensions of Environment, Social and Economic 
		Developments. In long term, the SGDs will be a major factor to identify challenges, success turn and gaps within the countries supporting the partnerships on identifying the best solutions and best practises.
		The agenda can also be known as the people centered process which would give the authority for human rights and gender sensitivity particularly focusing on the broken, vulnerable and the low rated citizens out there.
