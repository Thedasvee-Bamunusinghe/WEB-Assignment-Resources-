index.html is will be the main page for the website. So make sure to put the relevant elements there when developing the frontend.
What we need is: 

Connection to database and CRUD operations, 
PHP for backend elements, 
Javascript functions.

Remember to mark issues and always commit changes. Explain what changes were made and how they'll affect the current work. Remember to put comments in the code explaining what the areas you added do, be descriptive and get your point across clearly.

Main Page:Complete 
Second Page:Complete 
Form Page: Needs updates
Database: Needed


That is all!
