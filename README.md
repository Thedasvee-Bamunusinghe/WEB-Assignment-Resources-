Base.html is will be the main page for the website. So make sure to put the relevant elements there when developing the frontend.
What we need is: 
Relevant Webpage Content, 
CSS styling for form elements, 
Connection to database and CRUD operations, 
PHP for backend elements, 
Javascript functions.

Remember to mark issues and always commit changes. Explain what changes were made and how they'll affect the current work. Remember to put comments in the code explaining what the areas you added do.

That is all!
